# Fetch API for Synchronous ES6

Adds a basic version of fetch and its related objects to a synchronous ES6 only environment. Useful in an environment like ArcGIS Survey123, which does not include the Fetch API.

Not all features of the Fetch API can be replicated using a synchronous XMLHttpRequest. Major deviations from the standard are noted for each component.

## Components

- [Fetch](#fetch-function): Fetch content from the web.
- [Request](#request-class): Set the URL and options for a fetch request.
- [Response](#response-class): Response returned by a fetch request.
- [Headers](#headers-class): Set of headers used for both requests and responses.
- [URL](#url-class): Construct and manipulate URLs.
- [URLSearchParams](#urlsearchparams-class): Construct and manipulate the search parameters component of a URL.

---

## How to Use

Simply copy the content of the _script.js_ file into the file you need access to the fetch API. For example, in ArcGIS Survey 123, copy into your JavaScript code in the _Scripts_ tab of ArcGIS Survey 123 Connect.

## Fetch Function

> ðŸ”¸ **Deviation from standards**
>
> - Operation is synchronous and will block until the HTTP request has completed.
> - Returns the response instead of a promise.
> - Limited number of options.
> - Limited format support for the request body.
> - Only supports text responses (no blobs). This is a limitations of synchronous XMLHttpRequest.

The fetch function starts the processes of fetching a resource from the network.

```js
fetch(resource)
fetch(resource, options)
```

### Parameters

#### `resource`

One of:

- URL of resource to fetch as a string.
- An instance of the [URL Class](#url-class).
- An instance of the [Request Class](#request-class).

#### `options`

An object with custom settings to be applied to the request.

- `method`: The request method (e.g. GET or POST).
- `headers`: An instance [Headers](#headers-class) or an object literal containing header-name/value pairs.
- `body`: The body of the request either as a [URLSearchParams](#urlsearchparams-class) object or as plain text (you will need to handle headers yourself with the latter). You cannot set a body for a GET or HEAD request.

Will be ignored if a [Request Class](#request-class) is used for the `resource` parameters.

### Return Value

The HTTP Request response as an instance of the [Response Class](#response-class).

### Example

```js
let response = fetch("https://example.com/resource", {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
        "x-auth-key": "abc-123-xyz",
    },
});

if (response.ok) {
    let content = response.text();
}
else {
    console.error(`Failed to fetch resource â€“ ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`);
}
```

---

## Request Class

> ðŸ”¸ **Deviation from standards**
>
> - Limited set of options and properties available.
> - Limited format support for the request body.
> - The `text()` and `json()` methods return the content rather than a promise.
> - The body can be read multiple times.

The interface of the Fetch function which represents the resource request.

### Constructor

```js
new Request(input)
new Request(input, options)
```

#### `input`

Either:

- The URL of the resource as a string or a [URL](#url-class) object.
- Another Request object to be copied.

#### `options`

An object with custom settings to be applied to the request.

- `method`: The request method (e.g. GET or POST).
- `headers`: An instance [Headers](#headers-class) or an object literal containing header-name/value pairs.
- `body`: The body of the request either as a [URLSearchParams](#urlsearchparams-class) object or as plain text (you will need to handle headers yourself with the latter). You cannot set a body for a GET or HEAD request.

Will be ignored if a [Request Class](#request-class) is used for the `input` parameters.

### Properties

#### `body`

â„¹ read-only

The raw content of the body. Use of the `text()` or `json()` methods is preferred over this non-standard property.

#### `headers`

â„¹ read-only

#### `method`

â„¹ read-only

The request method (e.g. POST, GET, etc.)

### Example

```js
let r = new Request("https://example.com/resource", {method: "GET"});
```

## Headers Class

Interface to work with headers for fetch requests.

### Constructor

```js
new Headers()
new Headers(init)
```

#### `init`

#### `delete(key)`

Remove the key-value pair from the headers.

#### `entries()`

Returns a new Iterator object that contains an array of [key, value] for each element in the headers object in insertion order.

#### `forEach(callbackFn, thisArg=undefined)`

Executes a provided function once for each key/value pair in the headers.

#### `get(key)`

Returns the value associated to the key, or null if there is none. If a header has multiple values, all values will be in the same string separated by a comma.

#### `has(key)`

new URLSearchParams()
new URLSearchParams(init)
```

#### `init`
